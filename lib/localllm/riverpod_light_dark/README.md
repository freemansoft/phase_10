## Prompt

Create a flutter main.dart to implement the following game program in Flutter.

- This is a game score-keeping application built in flutter that can be used when playing the card game "phase 10".
- The program should capture individual phase/round scores for 8 players for up to 12 rounds, and calculate the total score for each player as the sum of the round scores. It should also display the sum of the round scores and a place for an editable player name
- The application should have an appbar and a switch to support light and dark mode.
- The UI should be a horizontally scrollable tabular UI that displays the player's name and total points in the first column of each row.   The table should scroll like a spreadsheet where the player's name and total are fixed while the rest of the spreadsheet can scroll horizontally.
- The first column of the UI should show the total score for each player and the player's name at the start of each row. The player's name should be editable. The total score field holds the sum of the scores for that player in that row.
- The next 12 columns hold the information for an individual round. There are two fields for each round. The individual round information fields contain the points for that round and a droplist containing the phase completed in that round, if any.   The score attribute is an editable numeric input field. The phase completed dropdown should offer a blank value and the numbers 1 through 10
- riverpod 2 or riverpod 3 should be used for state management
- Use some type of table that can freeze the first column possibly data_table_2 or flutter_table or table_sticky_headers
