# First pass

First attempt without riverpod or a light_dark switch using the agent mode in `Cursor`.  In theory, these should match the results for the same models in VSCode.

You will need to **REMOVE** riverpod from the `pubspec.yaml` file before trying to duplicate this with copilot

## Results

The in VSCode and Cursor were the same when using the same models.

## prompt

Create a flutter main.dart to implement the following game program in Flutter.

A game score-keeping application built in flutter for the card game "phase 10".

The program should capture individual phase/round scores for 8 players for up to 12 rounds, and calculate the total score for each player as the sum of the round scores. It should also display the sum of the round scores and a place for an editable player name

The UI should be a horizontally scrollable tabular UI that displays the player's name and total points in the first column of each row.   The table should scroll like a spreadsheet where the player's name and total are fixed while the rest of the spreadsheet can scroll horizontally. Use a Flutter table type that can freeze the first column.

The first column of the UI should show the total score for each player and the player's name at the start of each row. The player's name should be editable. The total score field holds the sum of the scores in that row.

The next 12 columns hold the information for an individual round. There are two fields for each round. The individual round information fields contain the points for that round and a droplist containing the phase completed in that round, if any.   The score attribute is a numeric input field. The phase completed dropdown should offer a blank value and the numbers 1 through 10
