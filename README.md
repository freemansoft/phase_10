# An attempt at building a phase 10 score sheet Flutter application using only local LLM

This was going to be a game score sheet built with just local LLM using a clean workspace for every attempt.
Eventually I gave up on this and moved to copilot because all of the models in copilot gave working code from a blank project.

See <https://github.com/freemansoft/fs-game-score> for the working app built with copilot
